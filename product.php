<div class="pro_detail"><h1>Teletector AD-T</h1>

The Teletector Probe 6150AD-t is a portable PTB approved probe for the Dose Rate Meter 6150AD to measure photon radiation (gamma and X-radiation). Two GM counting tubes placed at the telescope’s end serve as detectors covering a very wide dose rate range. The low range tube is placed behind the window in the front of the tube housing and can also detect beta radiation.

<h1>6150 AD-k</h1>

 

6150ad-kThe probe 6150AD-k uses a sealed proportional counter which does not require refilling or flushing from external gas reservoirs. Just like the probe 6150AD-17 it is sensitive to alpha, beta, and gamma radiation, however makes surveying larger areas much easier because of the much larger sensitive area.

<h1>6150AD-17</h1>



The detector of the probe 6150AD-17 is a GM counter with a circular end window. With the protective cap applied this probe can be used for general purpose gamma surveys. With the protective cap removed it is sensitive to alpha, beta, and gamma radiation thereby allowing to monitor surface contamination including wipe surveys.

 

 

 

 

 

Dose Rate Meter 6150 AD5automess_

Teletector 6112B

teletector-6112b

The Teletector 6112B-100 (indication in Sv/h) and the 6112B-101 (indication in R/h) are the classic models with an analog needle meter. The electronics, although completely redesigned in 2003, are purely analog too, i.e. without a microprocessor. Operation is extremely easy through one single rotary switch with seven positions Off / Battery Condition / five measuring ranges. This means that the range has to be selected manually.

 

 

 

6150 AD- 5/H

teletector-6112

Basically, there are two detectors with different ranges, and the instrument may have »additional functions« or not. This makes a total of four basic models as indicated in the table below (the former 6150AD3 and AD4 models are no longer required because they where replaced with AD5 and AD6). All of the four basic models are available for either the classical quantity Hx or the more modern H*(10).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Teletector 6112M/H

teletector-6112m

The Teletector 6112M(/H) is PTB approved and provides many additional functions. Model 6112M (without the /H suffix) is designed for the old quantity Hx, and model 6112M/H is for the quantity H*(10). The 6112M(/H) simultaneously measures dose rate, dose, average dose rate, standard deviation of the average, and maximum dose rate.
